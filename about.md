I am Andrea, but everyone calls me Izzy. I am an Italian Computer Engineering passionate about a lot of things that I will talk about here in the blog. My main interests include CTF challenges, playing video games, reading comics, and playing guitar.

I created this website during my free time after my master's degree. As my main goals, I would like to share my passions and train and improve my English writing skills. I hope you may find what I post interesting.

I wish you a good reading!
